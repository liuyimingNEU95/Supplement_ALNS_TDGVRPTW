1. The file named "Dataset" contains benchmark instances from Solomon's benchmark datasets (1987), 
Gehring and Homberger's benchmark datasets (1999), and real-life datasets (De Smet & Wauters, 2021) 
used in the paper "Efficient Feasibility Checks and an ALNS Algorithm for the TDGVRPTW". 
And the original instances need to be modified. Please check the paper for more details.

2. The file named "TDGVRP-ALNS-" contains algorithm code for different datasets.
